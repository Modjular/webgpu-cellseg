// Empirical roofline for whatever GPU this page is running on.
//
// The report's Phase 0 normalises each kernel against its *attainable* roof, which needs
// peak FLOP/s and peak bandwidth. Those come off a spec sheet on NVIDIA hardware. Here
// they cannot: Apple publishes no FLOP/s or bandwidth figure for the M-series GPU that
// is meaningful for this workload, and WGSL f32 compute cannot reach M5's neural
// accelerators anyway — so even a correct vendor peak would be the wrong roof.
//
// So measure it, ERT-style. Three probes:
//
//   computeRoof     FMA-saturated, no memory traffic          -> GFLOP/s
//   bandwidthRoof   streaming triad past any cache            -> GB/s
//   intensitySweep  the curve between them                    -> the actual ridge point
//
// The third is the one that matters most, because it locates the ridge *empirically*
// rather than as a ratio of two separately-measured peaks. On unified memory with a
// large system-level cache, that ratio is not trustworthy.
//
// Everything here is self-contained: its own pipelines, its own buffers, no engine
// involvement. It is also the only part of Phase 0 whose numbers are a property of the
// machine rather than of Cellpose.

//   - Exactly one FMA per chain per trip, with `k` and `c` read from the uniform. An

//     TFLOP/s — 3x the swept plateau — because `a*k+c` applied four times with known
